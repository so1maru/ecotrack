# ecotrack
MIGRATION TO PYTHON COMPLETE!!!
README CONTENT GOES HERE

NOTE: First draft of blank app is up and running. Only my (Soichi's) ssh key works for cloning right now. (You can still clone with https.) Please collaborate. Open pull requests when needed. We also need a website. Commit messages are auto-generated. Name was changed to "ecotrack" as flutter lacks support for capitals in project names.
