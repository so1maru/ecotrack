# ecotrack
MIGRATION TO PYTHON COMPLETE!!!
README CONTENT GOES HERE

NOTE: OPENING A PULL REQUEST WHEN EDITING IS COMPULSORY!!! DON'T BREAK STUFF WITH RANDOM COMMITS/PUSHES

NOTE: First draft of blank app is up and running. Only my (Soichi's) ssh key works for cloning right now. (You can still clone with https.) Please collaborate. We also need a website. Commit messages are auto-generated. Name was changed to "ecotrack" as flutter lacks support for capitals in project names.

# Libraries
I have chosen [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to start us off. Open a pull request if you disagree. Message and descriptions are auto-suggested by Copilot.
